# Stock Market Demo

Demo practical for company I can not name but rhymes with "Jim Lane".  ;)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.6.

Key systems are Material.io, bootstrap 4 and NGRX with Redux DevTools

## About

This is a stream of demo stock orders, you can search from a few demo stocks such as "goog", "bbby" or "cog".

There are three per minute aggregates; minimum price, average price and maximum price.

At the bottom, there is a ngrx store based config that will restrict view of minimum and maximum aggregates depending on the "level" choosen.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --project=stock-market-demo` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
